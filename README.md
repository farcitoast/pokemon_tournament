## Basic rules
- Generation 3 (Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald).
- Double Battles.
- Max 1 legendary.
- Max 1 starter (e.g. can't have Charizard and Blastoise on the same team).
- _Banned moves_: Double Team, Minimize.
- _Banned pokémons_: Wobbuffet, Blissey (?).

## Notable mechanics and tips
- When a pokémon dies, the replacement is sent in before the turn ends.
- The first two slots on your team are your lead, make sure to order the pokémons in your team accordingly before the challenge begins.
- Types are physical or special, not moves. For instance, all Fire moves are special. Below the full list:
  - _Physical_: Normal, Fighting, Poison, Ground, Flying, Bug, Rock, Ghost, Steel.
  - _Special_: Fire, Water, Grass, Electric, Ice, Psychic, Dragon, Dark.
- Surf, Rock Slide, Water Spout, Eruption, Blizzard, and Icy Winds only target foes (there are other moves too, these are just the most relevant).
- Earthquake, Explosion, and Self-Destruct target all pokémons on the field, except the user (there are others too, these are just the most relevant).
- Spread moves that only target foes (i.e. Surf) have 50% damage reduction. _Example_: The damage done by Surf is split between the foes.
- Spread moves that target all pokémons on the field, except the user, have no damage reduction. _Example_: Earthquake will deal its usual damage to each pokémon.
- The moves **Protect** and **Detect** can be very useful in double battles, if used effectively. Even if both foes attack you in one turn, Protect / Detect will absorb both their attacks.
- Try to build a balanced team, all the pokémons should not have the same weaknesses. See [Resources](#resources) for a team builder tool to analyze the weaknesses and strenghts of a team.
- If uncertain about the effect of a move, check it out on Smogon (see [Resources](#resources))... some have different or unexpected behaviors in double battles (e.g. Reflect).

## Tournament formula
Two phases:
1. **Round-robin phase**: each player battles once all the other players. For each battle, the winner gets 1 point. The standings at the end of the first phase will be used to determine the pairings in the playoffs. If two or more players are even on points, head-to-head results dictate the final standings. If the head-to-head critera is not applicable[^1], a random order will be computed. Each player _must_ use the same team for all the battles, without any modification.
2. **Best-of-3 playoffs**: best-of-3 knockout phase, the pairings are shown below for 8 players. After the round-robin phase, each player is free to _change_ his team, but once the playoffs starts any modification is _forbidden_. In a best-of-3 series, after each battle players can change their lead.

Rules:
- In the round-robin phase, players can change team after each battle.
- In the playoffs phase, players can only use one team.

[^1]: Sometimes the head-to-head criterion cannot be used, such as in the case where three players A, B, and C are even on points and A defeated B, B defeated C, and C defeated A.
