Welcome to the first Pokemon Showdown official tournament! Below the rules and some useful tips.

## Basics
- Generation 3 (Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald).
- Double Battle.
- Max 1 legendary.
- Max 1 starter (e.g. can't have Charizard and Blastoise on the same team).
- Banned moves: Double Team, Minimize.

## Notable mechanics
- When a Pokemon dies, the replacement is sent in before the turn ends.
- The first two slots on your team are your lead, be sure to order them before the challenge begins.
- Types are physical or special, not moves. Example: all Fire moves are special and all Normal moves are phisical.
- Surf and Rock Slide only target foes.
- Earthquake and Explosion target all pokemons on the field.
- Spread moves that target only foes (i.e. Surf, Rock Slide) have 50% damage reduction. Example: The damage done by Surf is split between the foes.
- Spread moves that target all pokemons on the field (i.e. Earthquake, Explosion) have no damage reduction. Example: Earthquake will deal its usual damage to each pokemon.
