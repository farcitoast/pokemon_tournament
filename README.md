## Basics
- Generation 3 (Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald).
- Double Battles.
- Max 1 legendary.
- Max 1 starter (e.g. can't have Charizard and Blastoise on the same team).
- **Banned moves**: Double Team, Minimize.
- **Banned pokemons**: Wobbuffet, Blissey.

## Notable mechanics and tips
- When a Pokemon dies, the replacement is sent in before the turn ends.
- The first two slots on your team are your lead, be sure to order them before the challenge begins.
- Types are physical or special, not moves. Example: all Fire moves are special and all Normal moves are phisical.
- Surf and Rock Slide only target foes.
- Earthquake and Explosion target all pokemons on the field.
- Spread moves that target only foes (i.e. Surf, Rock Slide) have 50% damage reduction. _Example_: The damage done by Surf is split between the foes.
- Spread moves that target all pokemons on the field (i.e. Earthquake, Explosion) have no damage reduction. _Example_: Earthquake will deal its usual damage to each pokemon.
- If in doubt on the effect of a move, check it out on Smogon (see Resources)... some have different or unexpected behaviors in double battles (e.g. Reflect).
