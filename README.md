## Basic rules
- Generation 3 (Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald).
- Double Battles.
- Max 1 legendary.
- Max 1 starter (e.g. can't have Charizard and Blastoise on the same team).
- **Banned moves**: Double Team, Minimize.
- **Banned pokemons**: Wobbuffet, Blissey (?).

## Notable mechanics and tips
- When a Pokemon dies, the replacement is sent in before the turn ends.
- The first two slots on your team are your lead, make sure to order the pokemons in your team accordingly before the challenge begins.
- Types are physical or special, not moves. Example: all Fire moves are special and all Normal moves are phisical.
- Surf and Rock Slide only target foes.
- Earthquake and Explosion target all pokemons on the field, except for the user.
- Spread moves that target only foes (i.e. Surf, Rock Slide) have 50% damage reduction. _Example_: The damage done by Surf is split between the foes.
- Spread moves that target all pokemons on the field (i.e. Earthquake, Explosion) have no damage reduction. _Example_: Earthquake will deal its usual damage to each pokemon.
- If uncertain about the effect of a move, check it out on Smogon (see Resources)... some have different or unexpected behaviors in double battles (e.g. Reflect).

## Tournament formula
2 phases:
1. **Round-robin phase**: each player battles once all the other players. For each battle, the winner gets 1 point. The ranking at the end of the first phase will be used to determine the pairings in the playoffs. If two or more players are even on points, head-to-head battles will be used to dictate the final standings. If head-to-head is not applicable, a random order will be computed.
2. **Best-of-3 playoffs**: best-of-3 knockout phase, the pairings are shown below for 8 players.
